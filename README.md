 Sentiment Analysis of Tweets & predicting Stock prices based on user sentiments about # Amazon
 
 Dataset : We have created both the data sets on our own.
 (1) data.json - Is a dictionary holding a key-value pair of sentiment ( 1 for positive & 0 for negative )
     "key" is the sentiment ( either 0 or 1 ) & "value" is the sample tweet.
 (2) data.txt - sample data file holding 2 columns & 100 rows (rows denote no of cases)
     column ( tweet_sent ) - holds data if the tweet was positive ( 1 ) or negative ( 0 ).
     column ( stock_sent ) - holds data if stock price rose ( 1 ) or fell ( 0 ).
     0 for fall/-ve sentiment & 1 for rise/+ve sentiment
 We lack proper datasets for both Stock data & tweets of same timeframe.
